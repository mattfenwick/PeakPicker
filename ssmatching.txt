a. create 1 spin system per hsqc peak
b. put hnco peaks into *all* spin systems within tolerance
  tolerances:
    N:  0.2 PPM
    H:  0.025 PPM


place HNCACB peaks into spin systems.
match based on finding matching NHSQC peak, then placing HNCACB
peaks into all spin systems of NHSQC peak.
  tolerances:
    N: 0.1 PPM
    H: 0.0125 PPM
