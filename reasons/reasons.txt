2nd Talos run -- fix C' shift query
     the C' belongs in residue i-1, not i

input and output from first talos run

remove i-1 tags from HCCHTocsy atomtype tags

HCCH-Tocsy assignments

HCCH-Tocsy peak-pick, group peaks into spin systems

fix incorrect atomtype assignment to peak dimension
     BMRB statistics
     crosspeak assignment

fix presumed typo in peak-to-ss assignment
     HC(CO)NH shifts did not match backbone N/H shifts of NHSQC peaks

fix flipped CB/CG (i-1) assignments of C(CO)NH peaks using HNCACB.  error probably caused by accident
     fix mistake

reassign atomtypes of hbCBcgcdceHE peaks in the H-dimension
     aromatic HD* peaks also show up
     thus, peaks that show up in the same place in this experiment as in the hbCBcgcdHD are *probably* HD* peaks
     peaks that show up in this experiment but not in the hbCBcgcdHD are *probably* HE* peaks
     solution: retag peaks appropriately based on chemical shift matching

assign hbCBcgcdHD and hbCBcbcdceHE peaks into spin systems, and assign atomtypes

initial peak picks of aromatic-linking experiments, including parameterizations

finish assigning HCCONH-Tocsy and HBHA(CO)NH

assign SS106 to G106, and pick matching peak
     N shift indicative of an ending G
     seems to have an overlapped peak which could be the CA(i-1) of G105
     crosspeak

fill in missing assignment for G78
     three SS that matched the CA(i-1) shift of following SS37(79R)
     SS63 was clearly not a G b/c its G-peak was an i-1 instead of i
     SS137 had i-1 peaks inconsistent with the i peaks of SS2 (which had previously been assigned to residue N77) and was therefore impossible
     SS138 had a very weak CA peak in the G range, and did not have any obvious i-1 peaks, and so wasn't inconsistent with the data

start sequential SS chain
     G/T anchors
     matching CA/CB chemical shifts
     three spin systems matched SS51(i)
     SS79 inconsistent with the Phe demanded by the sequence
     SS110's peaks were not i-1
     SS77 appears to be consistent

add new i-1 HNCACB peak
     i crosspeak of preceding spin system

extend SS chain backwards
     three SS matched CA(i-1) of SS110
     SS31: matching CA peak was an i-1, not an i
     SS96: preceding aatype was not a Valine, as required by the sequence and the assignment of SS110
     SS135: correct i/i-1 peak type and preceding aatype

extend SS chain backwards
     three SS matched the i-1 peaks of SS79
     SS77's matching peaks seemed to be i-1 peaks, and it was not preceded by a Glycine as demanded by the sequence (since SS79 was already assigned to a specific residue)
     SS51 was not preceded by a Glycine
     SS110 was preceded by a Glycine, and its i peaks matched the i-1 peaks of ss79

extend SS chain backwards
     3 SS matched the i-1 peaks of SS119
     SS76:  did not have a CB peak to match the i-1 of SS119
     SS87:  the matching CA peak seemed to be an i-1, not an i
     SS79:  this matched both the CA and CB peaks
     SS79 is not inconsistent with the data

extend sequential spin system assignment chain, assign i/i-1

assign sequential spin system
     spin systems 50, 96, 132, and 135 all match the glycine CA(i-1) peak of spin system 31
     spin system 31 is already assigned to 95D; from the sequence, we know that the preceding residue is 93D (and of course 94 is G)
     SS135: the i-1 peaks do not match the average shifts of D
     SS132: there are no i-1 peaks, leading me to suspect that it's two consecutive G residues
     SS50: the CB shift does not match D's average, and the CA of G appears to be an i-1 peak based on relative intensity compared to the other CA peak
