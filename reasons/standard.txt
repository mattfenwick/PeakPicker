standard reasons:
 - fixing mistakes
 - peak position -- edges of spectrum, location where no peaks are expected, or where e.g. water signals are expected
 - peak pattern -- sinc wiggles around peaks, phase errors
 - BMRB statistics -- specific atoms of specific amino acids in specific chemical shift ranges, which exclude other atomtypes/aminoacids
 - automated tool
 - crosspeaks -- use to identify peak where expected based on assignments of peaks into spin system
              -- or use to re-reference a spectrum?
              -- assign peaks into spin system
 - ?? process of elimination ??
 - aatype assignments of spin system -- dictates expected peaks and chemical shift ranges
 - primary sequence
 - SS-residue assignments
 - SS-SS assignments -- 
 - atomtype assignments
 - ?? overlap ??
 - i/i-1
 - SS type: sidechain/backbone/other
 - folding
 - peak sign




so:
 - what characteristics of the data would cause us to use one of the above reasons?
 - using a piece of information, what can be deduced? (perhaps given additional information ??)
 - is that the same thing twice?  just going forwards vs. backwards?
 - in other words: 1) how I can use something like that, and 2) what it tells me




the important thing about whether to go with a heavy annotation or not 
may not be how a deduction was made, but how difficult it was to deduce,
or perhaps how ambiguous the data was (in the sense of how many different
plausible interpretations it allowed)
