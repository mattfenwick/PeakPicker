mistaken interpretation of hbCBcgcdceHE
 - problem
   - reassign atomtypes of hbCBcgcdceHE peaks in the H-dimension
     aromatic HD* peaks also show up
 - resolution
   - peaks that show up in the same place in this experiment as in the hbCBcgcdHD are *probably* HD* peaks
     peaks that show up in this experiment but not in the hbCBcgcdHD are *probably* HE* peaks
   - solution: retag peaks appropriately based on chemical shift matching

possible overlap
 - problem
   - find G106's SS
   - no good matches for SS of G105
 - resolution
   - seems to have an overlapped peak which could be the CA(i-1) of G105
   - N shift indicative of an ending G

ambiguity
 - problem
   - multiple matching SS
   - i: 37
   - i-1: 63, 137, 138
   - i-2: SS2
 - resolution
   - SS63: not a G -- G-peak was an i-1 instead of i -- inconsistent with sequence
   - SS137: i-1 peaks inconsistent with the i peaks of SS2 (sequence, seq-specific assns)
   - SS138: very weak CA peak in the G range, no obvious i-1 peaks, so not inconsistent

ambiguity
 - problem
   - multiple matching SS
   - i: 51
   - i+1: 79, 110, 77
 - resolution
   - SS79: inconsistent with sequence, seq-specific assns
   - SS110: matching peaks not i-1
   - SS77: appears to be consistent

ambiguity
 - problem
   - multiple matching SS
   - i: 110
   - i-1: 31, 96, 135
 - resolution
   - SS31: matching CA peak was an i-1, not an i
   - SS96: preceding aatype was not V (sequence, seq-specific assns)
   - SS135: correct i/i-1 peak type and preceding aatype

ambiguity
 - problem
   - multiple matching SS
   - i: 79
   - i-1: 77, 51, 110
 - resolution
   - SS77: matching peaks seemed to be i-1 peaks, and not preceded by G (sequence, seq-specific assns)
   - SS51: not preceded by G
   - SS110: preceded by G, i peaks match SS79(i-1) peaks

ambiguity
 - problem
   - multiple matching SS
   - i: 119
   - i-1: 76, 87, 79
 - resolution
   - SS76: no CB peak to match the i-1 of SS119
   - SS87: matching CA peak seemed to be an i-1, not an i
   - SS79: matches CA, CB peaks, is not inconsistent

ambiguity
 - problem
  - multiple matching sequential SS
  - i: 31
  - i-1: 50, 96, 132, 135
 - resolution
  - SS135: inconsistent with sequence, sequence-specific assignments
  - SS132: there are no i-1 peaks, leading me to suspect that it's two consecutive G residues
  - SS50: the CB shift does not match D's average, and the CA of G appears to be an i-1 peak based on relative intensity compared to the other CA peak
