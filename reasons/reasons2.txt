reassign atomtypes of hbCBcgcdceHE peaks in the H-dimension
     aromatic HD* peaks also show up
     thus, peaks that show up in the same place in this experiment as in the hbCBcgcdHD are *probably* HD* peaks
     peaks that show up in this experiment but not in the hbCBcgcdHD are *probably* HE* peaks
     solution: retag peaks appropriately based on chemical shift matching

assign SS106 to G106, and pick matching peak
     N shift indicative of an ending G
     seems to have an overlapped peak which could be the CA(i-1) of G105
     crosspeak

fill in missing assignment for G78
     three SS that matched the CA(i-1) shift of following SS37(79R)
     SS63 was clearly not a G b/c its G-peak was an i-1 instead of i
     SS137 had i-1 peaks inconsistent with the i peaks of SS2 (which had previously been assigned to residue N77) and was therefore impossible
     SS138 had a very weak CA peak in the G range, and did not have any obvious i-1 peaks, and so wasn't inconsistent with the data

sequence-specific assignment of sequential SS chain
     matching CA/CB shifts to assigned sidechain spin system
     sidechain: SS123
     backbone: SS11

start sequential SS chain
     G/T anchors
     matching CA/CB chemical shifts
     three spin systems matched SS51(i)
     SS79 inconsistent with the Phe demanded by the sequence
     SS110's peaks were not i-1
     SS77 appears to be consistent

extend SS chain backwards
     three SS matched CA(i-1) of SS110
     SS31: matching CA peak was an i-1, not an i
     SS96: preceding aatype was not a Valine, as required by the sequence and the assignment of SS110
     SS135: correct i/i-1 peak type and preceding aatype

extend SS chain backwards
     three SS matched the i-1 peaks of SS79
     SS77's matching peaks seemed to be i-1 peaks, and it was not preceded by a Glycine as demanded by the sequence (since SS79 was already assigned to a specific residue)
     SS51 was not preceded by a Glycine
     SS110 was preceded by a Glycine, and its i peaks matched the i-1 peaks of ss79

extend SS chain backwards
     3 SS matched the i-1 peaks of SS119
     SS76:  did not have a CB peak to match the i-1 of SS119
     SS87:  the matching CA peak seemed to be an i-1, not an i
     SS79:  this matched both the CA and CB peaks
     SS79 is not inconsistent with the data

assign sequential spin system
     spin systems 50, 96, 132, and 135 all match the glycine CA(i-1) peak of spin system 31
     spin system 31 is already assigned to 95D; from the sequence, we know that the preceding residue is 93D (and of course 94 is G)
     SS135: the i-1 peaks do not match the average shifts of D
     SS132: there are no i-1 peaks, leading me to suspect that it's two consecutive G residues
     SS50: the CB shift does not match D's average, and the CA of G appears to be an i-1 peak based on relative intensity compared to the other CA peak
