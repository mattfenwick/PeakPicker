## Important branches ##
 - `ab2` -- an attempt to pure more emphasis on the annotations that are not normal, i.e. where special and/or complicated analysis was required


### Old ###
 - `newjson` -- initial CCPN process.  commit messages in free-form text
 - `splitter` -- rebased version of `newjson` -- commits split where appropriate to try and keep each commit focused on a single thing, annotations in json with "summary", "reasons", and optionally "comments" and "questions" fields


### Less important ###
 - `anno` -- started to re-do CCPN analysis from scratch
