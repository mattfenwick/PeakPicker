## Important branches ##

 - `newjson` -- initial CCPN process.  commit messages in free-form text
 - `splitter` -- rebased version of `newjson` -- commits split where appropriate to try and keep each commit focused on a single thing, annotations in json with "summary", "reasons", and optionally "comments" and "questions" fields



### Less important ###

 - `anno` -- started to re-do CCPN analysis from scratch
